## Recommer-System

A recommender system to recommend movies, books or shopping items list based on search using Python.

## Used Algorithims and Libraries

1. Recommer system uses Python's Panda library to process the data.In this step, we remove noise from dataset, refine it and prepare it to apply algorithm. In this step we deal with missing data, null values, categorical data, and large values of data. Generally, data preprocessing cosists of the following steps: •	Import Libraries
•	Reading data

•	Identify missing values

•	Identify categorical data

•	Standardizing Data

•	Transformation

•	Data Split

2. It uses KNN algorithim to find recommended items to be shown for testing item. For that, it uses item category to shortlist 15 similar items which then shortened to 5 using items rating.

## DatSets used

Movies data from the folling [link](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/).

Books data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/meetnaren/goodreads-best-books/version/3#)
